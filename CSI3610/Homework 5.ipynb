    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Given an (unsorted) array of n elements where each element is of the form AAA#999#AA99#A9# where the A are characters in the range ’a’ to ’z’ and the 9 are characters in the range ’0’ to ’9’ and the # characters are from the set {@#$%&*}. Your task is to implement a sort of this array that will be as fast (asymptotically) as possible. (Much better than n log n)."

    "## My Approach\n",
    "During lecture, I tend to code alongside the notes, so as soon as I saw this homework assignment, I went straight to modifying the `binsort` method we wrote in class. I wanted to write a method that unpacks each array within the array `a`, and then converting each char to its ASCII value. Then I want to sort the array with binsort, change the ASCII values back to their letters, and pack them back together."
