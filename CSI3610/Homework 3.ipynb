    "## My Approach\n",
    "In order to find `k` numbers in an array `a` that sum to zero, I wanted to find all possible combinations in `a` of length `k`. In order to do that, I initially decided to try to do this with iteration. After days of frustration and annoyance, I finally decided to try this recursively, much to my dismay lol.\n",
    "\n",
    "My approach will be a loop that starts at zero, and ends at n-1, i.e. `len(a)`. Before this loop I want to make an empty array to store the possible permutations. Inside that for loop, I want to make a for-each loop that calls the method with a[:i] + a[i+1] (aka `next`)(everything other than a[i]) and decrements k. This will be our base case (see lines 2-3). "

    "## Correctness\n",
    "In the first for loop, I made two variables. `current` which equals `a[i]`, and `next` which equals an array missing `a[i]`. Within the second for loop, I want to append onto b `current + `whatever returns for the recursive for loop (aka `x`). For example, if I have array `a` which equals [1, 2, 3, 4] and `k = 2`, in the first iteration of the FIRST for loop, `current = 1` and `next = [2, 3, 4]`. It then goes into the recursion, and calls its own method, `combos`, with the parameters `(next, k-1)`. Long story short, this boils down to the second for loop returning the values of the array other than a[i] in their own arrays. Inside this for loop, those values are appended onto `b`, and the loop runs again. So from our previous step, since current = 1, and next = [2, 3, 4], the first entries in `b` are [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]]. And the next ones will have `2` in the 0 index for each array in the list. So their entries will be `[2, 1], [2, 3], [2, 4]`. And so on and so forth."
