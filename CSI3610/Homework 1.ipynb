The integer root function: iroot(k, n) returns the largest integer x such that xk does not exceed n, assuming k and n are both positive integers. (Of course, you must remain in the integer realm all the time; you are not allowed to simply call a floating point library and do floor(sqrt(k,n)).) You are allowed only the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Specifically you cannot use exponentiation (the operator **), let alone calling math.pow(). No library calls are allowed.",

Each time the while loop is executed `x` is incremented by one and `result` is reset back to 1. Under those two lines is the for loop.\n\nThe for loop is finite. It starts at 0 and ends at k-1, hence it executes exactly k times. The variable `result` starts at 1 each time the for loop is executed and is multiplied by `x` at each iteration. Hence, at the end it is equal to `x`<sup>k</sup>.",
