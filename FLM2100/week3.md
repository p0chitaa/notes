# Editing
> Honestly there isn't much to write about this lecture.

## For _Lost In Translation_
* Was there a certain scene where the editing really stood out to you?

> Yeah. God this movie sucked lol. One of the very first scenes where Bill Murray is being walked into the hotel. The shots are kinda hectic, with no singular person being the focus. Imo this kinda shows how unfamiliar Bill Murray's character is with the Japanese culture. Especially with how he received everyone's business cards and gifts and what not.

#### Don't forget to do project 2.
