# Mise-en-scene

>long story short, everything has meaning in a film class lmao

_Even if it wasn't originally intended._

## Shot Size
* Typically, the larger the subject on screen, the greater the impact or emotional weight.
* Longer shots with effective blocking can quickly communicate _massive_ amounts of information, important to the narrative and the character.

Long Shot (LS)
: View of whole set; i.e. multiple people?

Medium Shot (MS)
: Typically from the waist up

Close Up (CU)
: Typically a head shot

## Hitchcock Rule
> Whatever is most important to the story at a given moment should be largest thing on screen at that moment.

---
## Camera Angles
> you know all this shit, just write notes in case prof likes his specific definitions

Low Camera Angle
: Pretty much makes every main subject of the shot look bigger, cooler, tougher, more intimidating, etc. Makes us feel smaller than the subject(s).

High Camera Angle
: Has the opposite effect of a low camera angle.

Eye-Level Camera Angle
: When there's not supposed to be some big power dynamic, we're typically gonna be seeing eye-level camera angle.

## Editing
> "The dancing back and forth and mixing all of our shots."
