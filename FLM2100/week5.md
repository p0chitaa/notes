# Week 5

## Music
* Score
    * Something written for a movie
* Soundtrack
    * A pre-existing piece of music

## Sound Effects
* Foley
    * The playing/performance of sound effects along with a movie or piece of media

## Diegetic
Within the narrative world of the film.
* Can the characters hear it???
> ***If the answer is yes, then this is diegetic soundtrack.***

## Non-Diegetic
Not within the narrative world of the film.
* Can the characters hear it???
> ***If the answer is no, then this is non-diegetic soundtrack.***

Sometimes things can start off as diegetic and shift to non-diegetic and vice-versa.

## During _Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore_
1. How is soundtrack or score music being used creatively?
2. Can you find expressive uses of diegetic or non-diegetic sound?'
