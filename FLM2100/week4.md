# More Editing
> Not sure how much I can write about editing yet again.

## Juxtaposition
A + B = ?

## Lev Kuleshov
* The Kuleshov effect
    * More than just POV pattern

## Contrast
> Cutting directly from one thing to another forces our minds to mull over the relationship between the two things shown.

## Symbolic
* When the editing is symbolic (*no shit*)
> See apocalypse now water buffalo scene

## Parallel Action
Cutting back and forth between two or more scenes at different locations (and sometimes different times) that do not directly relate (*yet*)

## Cross Cutting
Cutting back and forth between two or more scenes at different locations (and sometimes different times) that *directly relate*

## Hollywood Montage
* A sequence where "we need to condense time, but also need a story to develop"
    * We need to believe karate kid practiced all summer so he's actually good now
    * And so on

# Jaws
## During the Movie
1. Is there any parallel action or cross cutting?
2. Any montage sequences?
