## Difference between `<div>` tag and `<section>` tag?
* You can apply some sort of styling and what not with `<div>`s (non-semantic tag)
* `<section>`s just split up pages (semantic tag). Everything enclosed in the `<section>` tag is correlated.

## More Design Criteria
* Each page should have a navigation menu
> For now, we are representing this with HTML lists until bro covers CSS

---
## `<div>` stuff
* Remember that you can give multiple `<div>`s the same class to share attributes.
For example:
```html
<div id="1" class="intro" />
<div id="2" class="intro" />
```


## 3 Parts
Ok so we know we can break down a webpage into 3 parts:
1. Heading
2. Body
3. Footer
> What should be the content of the header?
* Lets put the navbar in the header
