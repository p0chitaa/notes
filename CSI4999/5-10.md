# Lecture 2

## What is Scrum?
**Self organizing teams** choose ow best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team

### Core Agile Values
* *Incremental* development process
* Focused on *frequent delivery* of working product features to customer
* Dependent on *high level* customer interation throughout the process

> Key takeaway: SELL THE ACCESSIBILITY (especially when presenting)

* A **sprint**
  * One interation in Scrum
  * A basic unit of development in Scrum
  * A **sprint** is a time boxed unit (restricted to a duration)
    * Each **sprint** is set in advance

## Scrum Team
* **Product Owner**
  * *customer representative*
    * concerned about high level stuff
    * more on the "what" not the "how"
  * compiles the product backlogs (high level prioritized feature list)
  * An effective product owner has personal qualities like:
    * clear vision
    * create and maintain a full set of *product backlogs*
    * good *communication* skills
    * *decision-making*

## Sprint 0 Activities

### Make a Project Goal (1)
* The product owner defines the goal of the project
* It should state the main purpose of the project
* In business this would focus on the business need that the product will deliver to the customer

### List the Requirements
* Develop an initial list of product requirements based on your understanding of the goal
* Each product requirement should
  * Describe the functionality that the product will provide

### Develop the Product Backlog
* The requirements should be written as *user stories* which will become your product backlog
  * It describes what a produt must do, or how it will function from the *end users' perspective*
* This should be phrased as:
  * As a `<role>`, I need to `<goal>` so that `<business to be achieved>`
* Each requirement needs to be evaluated to make sure it doesn't need to be **broken down** into smaller requirements

## Product Backlog Requirements From Development Team
* The developers may add high level requirements to the product backlog
* An example would be to create a database to store and retrieve all user info.
* "As a developer, I need to be able to store ... in the database so when a user logs in each day I can retrieve and update the data, and save the data when the user saves it"

## Breaking Down Product Backlogs
* Requirements must be *detailed enough* so developers can determine associated tasks
* BEFORE: As a user I want to track my calorie intake and calories burned for a day
  * *How to track it? How to calculate it?*
* REVISED: 
  * As a user I want to be able to select from a list of foods and beverages that I consume during a day and have the total calorie amount added to the day's total.
    * we can still go *further down*
  * As a user I want to select from a series of exercises, with duration and effort (can talk easily, can talk with effort, cannot talk) and it will calcuate my calories burned based on my weight and age, and add to the day's total.

## User Story vs. Tasks
* A user story describes a requirement from the customer's perspective (end-user)
* As a development team you will break each user story into a series of tasks that you need to do to accomplish the requirement

> **The tasks in each sprint can be coded within 1 ~ 2 weeks**

## User Tests
* **Test** early, **test** often, **test** automatically

## At the End of a Sprint
* Sprint Review Meeting
* Sprint Retrospective

## Sprint Review Meeting
* Here the team demonstrates a potentially shippable product to the product owner
* The product owner will declare which items are done and which do not meet the acceptance criteria

## Sprint Retrospective
* Scrum Master discusses how the Spring went, and how it could've been improved
* Discuss how the team worked together
* Give feedback to each other

**Scrum master may choose to do the following:**
* Limits time of each presenter
* Reiterates the goal of the sprint at the start
* Keeps the product catalog visible and checks each item as its being discussed
* **Refine the product backlog, where you clarify the product backlog items based on its current sprint**

### Regarding the Peer Review
> If the third peer review is better than the arithmetic average of the three peer reviews, the third peer review score will be used
