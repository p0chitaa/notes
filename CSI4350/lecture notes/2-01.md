# Lecture 6
Ok so back to this...
```scheme
(define nth-element
    (lambda (lst n)
        (if(null? lst)
            (report-list-too-short n)
            (if(zero? n)
                (car lst)
                (nth-element (cdr lst)(n-1))))))
```

What if we called the function like this? How would it work out?
```scheme
(nth-element `(a b c d e) 3)
```

(divide and conquer lmao)
```scheme
= (nth-element `(a b c d e) 3)
= (nth-element `(b c d e) 2)
= (nth-element `(c d e) 1)
= (nth-element `(d e) 0)
= d
```

## Write a Procedure to Remove First Matching Element of List
Signature
```
remove-first: Sym x Listof(Sym) -> Listof(Sym)

usage: (remove-first s los) returns a list w the same elements arranged in the same order as los, except that the first occurance of the symbol s is removed
```

The procedure:
```scheme
(define remove-first
    (lambda (s los)
        (if(null? los)
            `()
        (if(eqv?(car los) s)
            (cdr los)
            (cons (car los) (remove-first s (cdr los)))))))
```

## Back To S-Lists
```
S-list ::== ({S-exp}*)
S-exp ::== Symbol | S-list
```
### Procedure to Substitute in an S-List
> Actually, we need two procedures bc we have two variables....
```
subst: Sym x Sym x S-list -> S-list
First Sym replaces the second

usage: (subst 'a 'b '((b c) (b () d))) yields '((a c) (a () d))
```

## ok so it looks like we're changing up our data to make this easier to handle...
```
S-list ::== ()
       ::== (S-exp . S-list)
S-exp  ::== Symbol | S-list
```

> Just watch the lectures for the explainations of the cases here. Lotta typing.

The code:
```scheme
subst: Sym x Sym x S-list --> S-list


(define subst
    (lambda (new old slist)
        (if(null? slist)
            `()
            (cons
                (subst-in-s-exp new old (car slist))
                (subst new old (cdr slist))))))
```

And here is `subst-in-s-exp`:
```scheme
subst-in-s-exp: Sym x Sym x S-exp -> S-exp


(define subst-in-s-exp
    (lambda (new old sexp)
    (if(symbol? sexp)
        (if(eqv? sexp old)
            new
            sexp)
        (subst new old sexp))))
```

## ONCE AGAIN
1. Write one procedure for each nonterminal in the grammar.
2. In each procedure, write one alternative for each production corresponding to that nonterminal.

## Data Type
What is a data type?
* Its essentially a class
> It's bunch of data or values and a bunch of functions that work on it

*How about an abstract data type?*
> To make a data type abstract, the implementation of functions must be hidden. Even better, the representation of data must be hidden.
