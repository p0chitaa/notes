# Lecture 6
Ok so back to this...
```scheme
(define nth-element
    (lambda (lst n)
        (if(null? lst)
            (report-list-too-short n)
            (if(zero? n)
                (car lst)
                (nth-element (cdr lst)(n-1))))))
```

What if we called the function like this? How would it work out?
```scheme
(nth-element `(a b c d e) 3)
```

(divide and conquer lmao)
```scheme
= (nth-element `(a b c d e) 3)
= (nth-element `(b c d e) 2)
= (nth-element `(c d e) 1)
= (nth-element `(d e) 0)
= d
```

## Write a Procedure to Remove First Matching Element of List
Signature
```
remove-first: Sym x Listof(Sym) -> Listof(Sym)

usage: (remove-first s los) returns a list w the same elements arranged in the same order as los, except that the first occurance of the symbol s is removed
```

The procedure:
```scheme
(define remove-first
    (lambda (s los)
        (if(null? los)
            `()
        (if(eqv?(car los) s)
            (cdr los)
            (cons (car los) (remove-first s (cdr los)))))))
```
