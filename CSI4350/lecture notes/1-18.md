# Lecture 3

## Smallest program in Scheme?
How about...
```scheme
#lang racket
(display "Hello") 
```

What about...
```scheme
#lang racket
1
```
###### (it's this one btw lol)
<br />

It simply just takes and evaluates the only expression in the code, and then prints it.

---
What do you think this returns?
```scheme
#lang racket
"Hello Racket"
```
**Output:**
```scheme
"Hello Racket"
```

---
How about...
```scheme
#lang racket
#t
```
**Output:**
```scheme
#t  ; true
```

---
So why does this only output `"jackpot"`?
```scheme
#lang racket
(
    if
        #t              ; condition
        "jackpot"       ; consequent
        "jail"          ; alternative
)
```
* The expression directly after `if` is the <mark>condition</mark>
* The expression directly after the condition is the <mark>consequent</mark>. Is evaluated if the condition is `true`.
* The expression directly after the consequent is the <mark>alternative</mark>. Is evaluated if the condition is `false`.

> For example, if line 4 was changed to `#f`, the the output would be `jail`.

---
Another small program...
```scheme
#lang racket
`()
```
This is actually a list. Here is what the syntax looks like:
```scheme
#lang racket
`(ele1 ele2 ele3...)    ; separated by spaces
                        ; starts w backquote
```

---
## `null?`
```scheme
#lang racket
(
    null? `()
)
```
**Output:**
```scheme
#t
```

This is a function call. This specific function checks if a list is empty.
* _Remember that the question mark is just part of the function name!_

Ok, so what if we didn't give the function a list? Something like `null? 5`


###### apparently this is supposed to throw an error but my output is:
###### > `#f`

---
## **SO...**
```scheme
#lang racket
(
    if
        (null? `())
        "jackpot"
        "jail"
)
```
**Output:**
```
"jackpot"
```

---
Another Built-in Function
```scheme
#lang racket
(
    cons 2 `()
)
```
This is a function call that takes two arguments.
* It takes an element as the first argument,
* a list as the second,

And concats the element to the list.
* Concatted element goes to the _beginning_ of the list.

---
## *sigh*
```scheme
#lang racket
(
    cons 7 (cons 5 (cons 2 `()))
)
```
**Output:**
```scheme
`(7 5 2)
```

---
# More Built-in Functions
## `car`
```scheme
#lang racket
(
    car (cons 7 (cons 5 (cons 2 `())))
)
```
**Output:**
```scheme
7
```

`car` is a function that takes one argument. 
* It returns the first element of the passed list.

## `cdr`
```scheme
#lang racket
(
    cdr (cons 7 (cons 5 (cons 2 `())))
)
```
**Output**:
```scheme
`(5 2)
```
`cdr` is a function that takes one argument (list)
* It creates a new list and copies all values of the passed list _except the first._
* "Returns the remainder of the list *minus* the first element.

## How do I extract element `2` from:
```scheme
cons 7 (cons 5 (cons 2 `()))
```
by just using `car` and `cdr`?

Suppose `x` is 
```scheme
`(7 5 2)    ; cons 7 (cons 5 (cons 2 `()))
```

All we need to do is `cdr` twice and `car` once:
```scheme
car (cdr (cdr x))
```

## `list`
```scheme
#lang racket
(
    car (list (list 7 18) 12)
)
```
Here the first `list` call creates a list with elements `7` and `8`. The second call creates a list with the first element being a list containing `7` and `8` and the second element being `12`.
```scheme
`(`(7 8) 12)
```

**Output:**
```scheme
`(7 18)
```

## Condition (`cond`) Expression
Essentially just a switch.
```scheme
#lang racket
(
    cond
        ((eqv? 1 1) "Good") ; option 1
        ((eqv? 1 2) "Bad")  ; option 2
        ((eqv? 1 3) "Ugly") ; option 3
        ; option (condition action)
)
```
sidenote 
: `eqv?` is a function that takes two parameters and checks if they're equal
**Output:**
```scheme
"Good"
```

## Local Variable Definition/Usage
```scheme
#lang racket
(
    let (
       (x 2) 
    )
    x
)
```
**Output:**
```scheme
2
```
* this is really straight forward and I don't feel like typing out an explaination lmfao

```scheme
#lang racket
(
    let (
        (x 2)
        (y 2)
    )
    (+ x y)
)
```
**Output:**
```scheme
4
```
