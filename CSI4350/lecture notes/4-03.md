## Safety = Operation operates on operands with correct types
1. For evaluations of `var`, the variable is bound
2. For evaluations o `(diff-exp exp1 exp2)`, the values of `exp1` and `exp2` and ***num-vals***
3. For evaluations of `(zero?-exp exp1)`, the value of `exp1` is ***num-val***.
4. For evaluations of `(if-exp exp1 exp2 exp3)`, the value of `exp1` is a ***bool-val***.
5. For evaluations of `(call-exp rator rand)`, the value of `rator` is a ***proc-val***.

## Type Checking Goal
Type checker is a procedure (program)
* Takes a program as its input, and decides statically (without running the program) if the program is safe
Is conservative (***sound***). That is, if the analysis:
* accepts the program, the program is safe
* is not sure if the program is safe, rejects it

## Examples
1. `if 3 then 88 else 99` **unsafe, 3 needs to be a `bool-val`**
2. `proc (x) (3 x)` **unsafe, the second 3 needs to be a `proc-val`**
3. `proc (x) (x 3)` **safe**
4. `proc (f) proc (x) (f x)` **safe**
5. `let x = 4 in (x 3)` **unsafe, x needs to be a `proc-val`**
6. `let x = zero?(0) in -(3, x)` **unsafe, x needs to be a num-val**
7. `let f = 3 in proc (x) (f x)` **unsafe, f needs to be a proc-val**

## Grammar (and Abstract Syntax) of Types
> grammar = concrete syntax?
```
Type ::== int
          int-type ()
Type ::== bool
          bool-type ()
Type ::== (type -> Type)
          proc-type (arg-type result-type)
```

## More Than 1 Type, No Type
> `proc (x) x`
* has type t-> t, for any t

> `proc (x) if x then 11 else zero?(11)`
* has no type

## `type-of`: Assign a Type to an Expression
###### this is our type checker
```
(type-of (const-exp num) tenv) = int
```

## `type-of`
```
(type of exp1 tenv) = int   (type-of exp2 tenv) = int
-----------------------------------------------------
       (type of (diff-exp exp1 exp2) tenv) = t2
```

```
(type-of exp1 tenv) = t1   (type-of body [var=t1]tenv) = t2
-----------------------------------------------------------
        (type-of (let-exp var exp1 body) tenv) = t2        
```

```
        (type-of exp1 tenv) = bool
        (type-of exp2 tenv) = t
        (type-of exp3 tenv) = t
------------------------------------------
(type-of (if-exp exp1 exp2 exp3) tenv) = t
```

```
      (type-of body [var=t1]tenv) = t2
---------------------------------------------
(type-of (proc-exp var body) tenv) = t1 -> t2
```
