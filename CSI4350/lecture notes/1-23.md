## Function Definition Using Lambda
```scheme
#lang racket
(
    lambda(x y) ; remember that lambda is a keyword
    (+ x y)
)
```
This is a function that returns the sum of two passed numbers.

**Output?**
```scheme
#<procedure>
```
This is a "function value."
* Function values represent the declaration of a function.

The name of this function?
* Doesn't have one.

## Function Definition (And Usage) Using Lambda
```scheme
#lang racket
(
    (lambda(x y)(+ x y)) 3 5    ; parameters are passed at the end
)
```
**Output:**
```scheme
8
```

## Function Definition Using `let`
```scheme
#lang racket
(
    let (
        (sum (lambda (x y)(+ x y))) ; variable declaration
                                    ; passing the function as a value
    )
    (sum 2 3)
)
```
**Output:**
```scheme
5
```
Long story short, functions are values.

## Function Definition Using `define`
```scheme
#lang racket
(define
    sum
    (lambda
        (x y)
        (+ x y)
    )
)
(sum 2 3)
```

## The Differences?
* `let` creates ***LOCAL*** variables
* `define` creates ***GLOBAL*** variables

---
## Variable Definition Using `define`
```scheme
#lang racket
(define x 2)
(+ x 1)
```
**Output:**
```scheme
3
```
We do this the same way we set names to functions with `define`, but just a value instead of a function.

## How About...
```scheme
#lang racket
(define x 2)
(+ x 1)
(+ x 1)
```
**Output?**
```scheme
3
3
```
* Remember that we cannot assign new values to variables once assigned.
* So in the first `(+ x 1)`, it returns 1 number larger than `x`. `x` is not modified.

## Commenting
```scheme
; a semicolon for one line
#| a pound sign and a pipe,
   and ends with pipe and pound |#
```

## And Now We're Done With the Scheme Intro
fuck.

## Inductive Data
***Example:***

(This is our informal definition.)

Set S is a subset of N that satisfies the following two properties:
1. 0 $\epsilon$ S
2. If n $\epsilon$ S then (n+3) $\epsilon$ S
> S = {0, 3, 6, 9, 12,...}

The reasoning?
* If n $\epsilon$ S, then (n+3) $\epsilon$ S.
* If n = 0 $\epsilon$ S, then (0+3) $\epsilon$ S
* And so on.

## Other Ways to Specify/Define Inductive Data?
An inductive data type, `x`, can be defined in multiple ways.
1. Informally in English
2. Inference Rules


## Inference Rules
***Example:***
```
condition 1 condition 2 condition 3 ...
---------------------------------------
            conclusion
```
**Meaning:**
* If `condition 1`, `condition 2`, and `condition 3` hold, then we can conclude `conclusion`

## So lets take our earlier informal English definition.

Number 1: 0 $\epsilon$ S

Changes to:
```
            //axiom. a rule with no condition
-----
0 ∈ S
```

Number 2: If n $\epsilon$ S then (n+3) $\epsilon$ S

Changes to:
```
  n ∈ S
---------
(n+3) ∈ S
```

## List of Integers Definition
A Scheme list is a list of integers iff:
1. It is the empty list, or
2. It is a pair whose `car` is an integer and whose `cdr` is a list of integers.

> The only reason "pair" is used in this definition is because of how Scheme understands lists. Lists in scheme are essentially an element paired with the rest of the list.

## Another List of Integers Definition
The set List-of-Int is the smallest set of Scheme lists satisfying the following two properties:
1. () $\epsilon$ List-of-Int, and
2. if n $\epsilon$ Int and 1 $\epsilon$ List-of-Int, then (n . 1) [^1] $\epsilon$ List-of-Int

[^1]: The dot is a concatenation function. `n` is an integer, and `l` is a list.


## List of Ints Inference Rule(s)
```
() ∈ List-of-Int                //base


n ∈ Int   l ∈ List-of-Int
--------------------------      //inductive
  (n . 1) ∈ List-of-Int
```
**Some Examples?**
> (), (14.()), (3.(14.())), (-7.(3.(14.())))


## So How Do We Infer Actual Examples?
Lets try to infer `(14.())`.
1. () ∈ List-of-Int
2. 14 ∈ Int
3. l ∈ List-of-Int
4. (14.()) ∈ List-of-Int
```
() ∈ List-of-Int (conclusion)
            \
             \
14 ∈ Int     -- (cond., since the used conclusion holds)
---------------------------
  (14 . ()) ∈ List-of-Int
```


## How About `(-7.(3.(14.())))`???
```
() ∈ List-of-Int (conclusion)
            \
             \
14 ∈ Int     -- (cond., since the used conclusion holds)
---------------------------
  (14 . ()) ∈ List-of-Int
            \
             \
3 ∈ Int      -- (cond. since the new conclusion holds)
-----------------------------
  (3.(14.())) ∈ List-of-Int
            \
             \
-7 ∈ Int     -- (cond. for the same reason(s) as before)
---------------------------------
  (-7.(3.(14()))) ∈ List-of-Int
```
dope.


## Third Way to Define Inductive Data
Grammar. See CSI 3430 notes if need be.
```
List-of-Int::== ()                      # rule 1
List-of=Int::== (Int . List-of-Int)     # rule 2
```
