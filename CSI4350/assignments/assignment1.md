## 1. ***[10 points]*** What sets are defined by the following pairs of rules? Explain why and also list a few members of each set.

### a. 
```
                 (n, k) ε S
(0, 1) ε S      ------------  
               (n+1, k+7) ε S
```

> The set defined by the above rules contains pairs starting at (0, 1) with the following rules: if (n, k) belong in the set S, then so does (n+1. k+7). Given that (0, 1) ε S, so does (1, 8), (2, 15), (3, 22), (4, 29), (5, 36), and so on.

### b.
```
                 (n, k) ε S
(0, 1) ε S      -------------  
                (n+1, 2k) ε S
```

> The set defined by the above rules contains pairs starting at (0, 1) with the following rules: if (n, k) belong to the set S, then so does (n+1, 2k). Given that (0, 1) ε S, then so does (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 8), (4, 16), (5, 32), and so on. To put an informal definition on this set, it contains powers of two, where n represents the exponent and k represents the product.
